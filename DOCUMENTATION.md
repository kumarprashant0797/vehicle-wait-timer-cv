# Vehicle Wait Timer - Computer Vision System

## Approach and Design Choices

### 1. Architecture Overview
The system is built using a modular, object-oriented approach with three main components:
- `Vehicle`: Represents individual vehicles and tracks their timing information
- `VehicleTracker`: Manages multiple vehicles and their states
- `VideoProcessor`: Handles video processing, object detection, and visualization

### 2. Technology Stack
- **Computer Vision Framework**: OpenCV (cv2) for video processing and visualization
- **Object Detection**: YOLOv8n (nano model) for efficient real-time vehicle detection
- **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration for easy system customization

### 3. Key Design Choices

#### 3.1 Object Detection
- Using YOLOv8n model for optimal balance between speed and accuracy
- Focused detection on vehicle class (class 2 in COCO dataset) to reduce processing overhead
- Configurable confidence threshold (currently 0.25) for detection reliability

#### 3.2 Vehicle Tracking
- Simple yet effective center-point tracking algorithm
- Distance-based vehicle association (50-pixel threshold)
- Dictionary-based vehicle storage for O(1) lookups
- Automatic cleanup of vehicles that leave the frame (1-second timeout)

#### 3.3 Region of Interest (ROI)
- Interactive ROI selection at startup
- Reduces processing area and improves accuracy
- Filters out irrelevant detections outside the target area

#### 3.4 Performance Optimizations
- Minimal frame modifications
- Efficient memory management with proper resource cleanup
- Optional display toggle for headless operation
- Configurable parameters for fine-tuning

#### 3.5 Output and Logging
- Real-time visualization with vehicle IDs and wait times
- Text-based logging of vehicle wait times
- Video output with annotations
- Structured data output for further analysis

## Recommendations for Ideal Setup

### 1. Hardware Requirements
- **Processor**: Modern multi-core CPU (i5/i7 or equivalent)
- **Memory**: Minimum 8GB RAM
- **Storage**: SSD recommended for faster video processing
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (optional but recommended)

### 2. Software Configuration
```yaml
video:
  source: "input.mp4"
  output: "output.mp4"
  display: true  # Set to false for headless operation

model:
  name: "yolov8n.pt"
  confidence: 0.25
  device: "cuda"  # Use "cuda" if GPU available

classes:
  include: [2]  # Vehicle class only
```

### 3. Optimization Recommendations
- **GPU Acceleration**: Enable CUDA support when available
- **Batch Processing**: For offline analysis, increase batch size
- **ROI Selection**: Choose minimal but sufficient area
- **Resolution**: Consider downscaling high-resolution inputs
- **Confidence Threshold**: Adjust based on lighting conditions
  - Daytime: 0.25-0.3
  - Night time: 0.2-0.25

### 4. Production Deployment Recommendations

   - Set up error logging

2. **Data Management**
   - Implement periodic log rotation
   - Set up automated backup of configuration
   - Consider database integration for analytics

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Use virtual environment for Python dependencies
   - Containerize the application for consistent deployment
   - Implement environment-specific configurations

4. **Performance Tuning**
   - Profile the application in production environment
   - Adjust ROI and confidence thresholds based on real conditions
   - Consider time-of-day specific configurations

### 5. Maintenance and Updates
- Regular model updates as new YOLO versions are released
- Periodic calibration of tracking parameters
- System logs analysis for optimization opportunities
- Regular backup of configuration and output data

## Edge Cases and Robust Wait Time Calculation

### 1. Identified Edge Cases

#### 1.1 Vehicle Detection Challenges
- **Occlusion Handling**: When vehicles are partially hidden behind other vehicles
- **Poor Lighting Conditions**: Dawn, dusk, or night-time scenarios
- **Weather Impact**: Rain, snow, or fog affecting detection
- **Vehicle Similarity**: Similar vehicles close to each other
- **Camera Position Changes**: Slight movements in camera affecting ROI
- **Frame Drops**: Missing frames affecting continuous tracking

#### 1.2 Timer Accuracy Issues
- **Vehicle Re-identification**: Same vehicle counted multiple times
- **Stop-and-Go Motion**: Vehicles moving slightly within ROI
- **Long Duration Parking**: Vehicles staying beyond expected timeframes
- **ROI Border Cases**: Vehicles partially entering/exiting ROI
- **System Restarts**: Handling timing across system interruptions

### 2. Implemented Solutions

#### 2.1 Current Robustness Features
- Simple center-point tracking for vehicle identification
- Distance-based association (50-pixel threshold)
- 1-second timeout for vehicle cleanup
- ROI-based processing to minimize false detections
- Real-time logging for audit trails

### 3. Recommended Enhancements

#### 3.1 Improved Vehicle Tracking
- **Feature-based Tracking**
  - Implement visual feature extraction (color histograms, SIFT features)
  - Use Kalman filtering for motion prediction
  - Add vehicle appearance modeling

- **Multiple Association Metrics**
  ```python
  def enhanced_vehicle_matching(self, vehicle, detection):
      # Distance score (existing)
      distance_score = calculate_distance_score()
      
      # Size similarity score
      size_score = calculate_size_similarity()
      
      # Color histogram similarity
      color_score = calculate_color_similarity()
      
      # Combined weighted score
      final_score = (0.5 * distance_score + 
                    0.3 * size_score +
                    0.2 * color_score)
      return final_score > MATCH_THRESHOLD
  ```

#### 3.2 Robust Timer Implementation
- **State Machine Approach**
  ```python
  class VehicleState:
      ENTERING = "entering"
      STOPPED = "stopped"
      MOVING = "moving"
      EXITING = "exiting"
      
  class EnhancedTimer:
      def update(self, current_state, movement):
          if self.state == VehicleState.STOPPED:
              self.accumulate_time()
          elif self.detect_significant_movement():
              self.state = VehicleState.MOVING
              self.pause_timer()
  ```

#### 3.3 Data Validation and Filtering
- **Temporal Smoothing**
  - Implementation of moving average for position
  - Outlier detection for sudden position changes
  - Confidence-based weight assignment

- **Smart Timeout System**
  ```python
  class AdaptiveTimeout:
      def calculate_timeout(self, vehicle):
          base_timeout = 1.0  # Base 1-second timeout
          # Adjust based on:
          # 1. Vehicle's historical presence
          # 2. Current traffic density
          # 3. Time of day
          return adjusted_timeout
  ```

#### 3.4 System Resilience
- **Data Persistence**
  - Periodic state serialization
  - Recovery mechanism for system interrupts
  - Rolling backup of vehicle states

- **Automatic Calibration**
  ```python
  class AutoCalibration:
      def adjust_parameters(self, performance_metrics):
          # Adapt tracking parameters based on:
          # 1. Detection confidence distribution
          # 2. Traffic patterns
          # 3. Environmental conditions
          update_tracking_parameters()
  ```
